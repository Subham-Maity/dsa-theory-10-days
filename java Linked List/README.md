# Linked list

## 1. Basic Notes
- Searching in linked list time complexity is O(n) 

- Searching in Array List time complexity is O(1) 

**1. so O(1) < O(n) so we can use ArrayList for searching.**


- Insertion in linked list time complexity is O(1)

- Insertion in Array List time complexity is O(n)

**2. so O(1) < O(n) so we can use linked list for insertion add operation.**

## 2. Basic Properties

- variable size - we can insert and delete any number of elements in linked list.
- Non-contiguous memory - Elements are not necessarily in adjacent locations in memory.
- Insert Time Complexity - O(1)
- Search Time Complexity - O(n)

**Extra**

- Delete Time Complexity - O(1)
- Access Time Complexity - O(1)
- Memory Usage - O(n)
- Iteration Time Complexity - O(n)
- Sorting Time Complexity - O(n^2)
- add operation - O(1)
- remove operation - O(1)
- get operation - O(1)
- set operation - O(1)
- contains operation - O(n)
- clear operation - O(n)
- size operation - O(1)
- isEmpty operation - O(1)
- toArray operation - O(n)
- toString operation - O(n)
- equals operation - O(n)
